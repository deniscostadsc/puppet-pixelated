# Pixelated Threat-Model
WORK IN PROGRESS
Please try to use markdown syntax.

## Threat Model Information
###Description
A software distribution that helps organisations implement a secure* email/groupware solution. It builds on LEAP as an encrypted mail provider and adds a web based frontend.

(*)In this context secure means that communication cannot be intercepted trivially by adversary parties. The goal is not, and arguably cannot be, to make communication secure against all known and unknown adversaries.
###Participants
Folker Bernitt, Christoph Kl√ºnter, Lisa Junger

## Assumptions
* Platform providers obtain an authentic copy of Pixelated
* Users have some kind of certificate check in place (e.g. do not accept untrusted certificates)
* The servers running the platform are not compromised by malware
* The security assumptions of used crypto are valid

## External dependencies
1. The Pixelated platform is hosted on one or more linux servers. The distribution is not fixed, so ubuntu, debian, centos or RHEL are valid choices. The servers will be hardened using the puppet scripts provided by LEAP platform. The patch level for the OS depends on the chosen platform.
2. The backend service is provided by the [LEAP](https://www.leap.se "LEAPs homepage") project
4. The frontend in form of the Pixelated dispatcher and the Pixelated User Agent are custom developments by the Pixelated team
5. The Pixelated platform only provides encrypted access to its various services, e.g. HTTPS or SMTPS (see below for details about boundaries)

## Assets/Data
### Encrypted mails
- Symmetrically encrypted mails are stored in a Couchdb database
- GPG encrypted mails are stored in a Couchdb database (incoming mail)
- GPG public and private key
  - Being a SaaS model the server needs access to the (encrypted) private key
  - The key needs to be unlocked on the server-side, therefore the server needs access to the plaintext passphrase as well
- LEAP provides a key lookup service (key server) which provides public keys for all registered users
- The intention of the Pixelated platform is to never persist unencrypted mail on the server

### User credentials
- The server has to keep a list of user credentials (username and password) to authenticate and authorize users
- The password might either be used directly as the gpg passphrase or to unlock the gpg private key passphrase

### Email addresses
- The server stores a list of all valid email addresses
  - Poorly chosen can hint to the owner

### LEAP persisted data
All data that the LEAP provider persists
- Logfiles (SMTP, HTTP, Couchdb)
- encrypted mails in Couchdb

### Log files
- Some typical server logs are generated, IP addresses have to be anonymized as good as possible
- Might reveal user behaviour like times when mails are read

## Data Transports at boundaries

### HTTPS access through Web-Frontend
The Pixelated platform provides a web front (User Agent) by which users can access (read and write) emails. This transport is secured using a recent SSL version. Using perfect forward secrecy is mandatory. Each user has full access to his/her account. Mails are moved unencrypted through this transport (decryption happens on the server).

### SMTP (encrypted with plaintext fallback)
Pixelated provides a mail service and uses SMTP to forward mails to their recipients. There is a best effort mechanism in place to send mails by encrypted transport. But if that fails there is a fallback in place using plaintext only.
Note: Pixelated tries to encrypt the mail body with GPG whenever possible. Therefore Pixelated can leak metadata in form of headers when using the SMTP protocol. It is planned to add an option to abort forwarding mails if content encryption is not possible (i.e. no valid public key is known for all recipients)

### Pixelated platform web frontend
Pixelated provides access to the Pixelated platform web frontend. This is necessary to allow direct login to the Pixelated platform and avoiding the Pixelated User Agent.

### LEAP soledad API
Provides access to the mail database of each user. 
- Secured by auth token acquired by SRP login on LEAP server
- Seems to be a protocol on top of HTTPS
- Port has to be accessible from the outside to support direct client access

### LEAP Nicknym API
Provides a key lookup service that allows access to public keys of all known users
- RESTful service on top of HTTPS
- Service uses no authentication and only has access to public key data
- Port has to be accessible from the outside to support direct client access as well as server to server lookup

### SSH access for Administration
All services provide SSH access for administration and maintenance. It allows key based authentication only and does not allow password login

## Data Transports internal

### Couchdb cluster
Couchdb, i.e. BigCouch, synchronises itself over an HTTP protocol. Most of the content Couchdb has access to is encrypted (either symmetrically or by GPG).
Unencrypted data:
    - hashed user ids
    - documents (each one representing an encrypted email)
    - document ids
    - document versions
    - document timestamps

### Nagios Monitoring
LEAP sets up Nagios to monitor the instances. Analysis of how Nagios accesses hosts is pending

## System Users / Privilege Separation
As multiple users are accessing the Pixelated platform it is important to isolate the users from each others as good as possible to avoid accidental access to secret data. For archiving purposes it makes sense to implement some kind of privilege separation.
TBD

## Encryption Cyphers and Tools

### HTTPS
- TBD: List of allowed cyphers
- TBD: List of supported browsers

### Languages, Tools, Libraries

## Known problems

### GPG Passphrase

### Web based - what does that mean

## STRIDE
A threat categorization such as STRIDE is useful in the identification of threats by classifying attacker goals such as: 

### Spoofing 

### Tampering 

### Repudiation 

### Information Disclosure 

### Denial of Service 

### Elevation of Privilege.

## Scenarios

### What the platform provider of an uncompromised server can achieve:
* It can learn when a user is online and accessing his/her mail
* It can learn how many mails a user sends and receives
* It can learn timestamps about sent and received mail
* It can learn the approximate size of any mail sent or received
* It can access the (encrypted) private key of any user
* It can delete or corrupt mails of users
* It can spam users with messages
* It can duplicate messages

### What a global, passive adversary (one who can observe all Internet traffic) can achieve:
This is the use case for Pixelated.
* The adversary can learn who is using the Pixelated platform
* The adversary can learn when messages are sent or received
* The adversary can learn to what destination servers messages are sent
* The adversary can learn from which source servers messages are received
* The adversary can learn which user is the sender of an outgoing message with high probability (time correlation)
* The adversary can learn from which servers public GPG keys are requested
* The adversary can read mail headers if mails are sent to servers not supporting encryption

### What a physical seizure of a server can achieve
* Access to LEAP database with encrypted data
* Access to encrypted private keys
* Possible key material or mail content in swap space
Possible mitigation: Encrypt disks (still vulnerable by cold boot attack)

### What a hijacked server can achieve
Same as seizure as well as:
* Access to user passwords by manipulated dispatcher and by this access to unlocked private keys

### What a physical seizure of a users computer can achieve
If user only uses web-client: 
* Files in Browser caches
If  user uses local Pixelated installation
* Access to encrypted Bitmask database, access to encrypted private keys and possible access to unencrypted mails, e.g. if user accesses Bitmask through Thunderbird, etc.
